Write a function that plays tic-tac-toe
    game is played on a 3x3 grid
    played by 2 players, who take turns

You should create an array to represent the board
    can be of type char and consist of 10 elements (do not use zero)
    each element represents a coordinate on the board that the user can select

some functions that you should probably create:
    checkForWin - checks to see if a player has won or the game is a draw
    drawBoard - redraws the board fore each player turn
    markBoard - sets the char array with a selection and check for an invalid selection
