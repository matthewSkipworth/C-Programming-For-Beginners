We need to get some practice writing functions
    - better organized code
    - avoid duplication

for this challenge ou are to write three functions in a single program:

write a function which finds the greatest common divisor of two non-negative
integer values and return the result.
    - gcd takes two ints as parameters

write a function to calculate the absolute value of a number
    - should take as a parameter a float and return a float
    - test this function with ints and floats

write a function to compute the square root of a number
    - if a negative argument is passed then a message is displayed and -1.0 
    should be returned.
    - should us the absoluteValue function as implemented in the above step.
