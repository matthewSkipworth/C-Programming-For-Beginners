In this challenge, you are to create a C program that calculates your weekly pay.

The program should ask the user to enter the number of hours worked in a week via the keyboard (console)

The program should display as output the gross pay, the taxes, and the net pay.

The following assumptions should be made:
    -Basic pay rate = $12.00/hr
    -overtime (in excess of 40 hours/week) = time and a half
    -tax rate:
        15% of the first $300
        20% of the next $150
        15% of the rest...
